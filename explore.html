            <h2>Supermoon</h2>
            <p>A Supermoon happens when a full moon occurs while the Moon is at its closest proximity to Earth during its eliptical orbit. This point in time is called perigee. This phenomemon causes the moon to look larger and brighter. During Supermoons increase tidal effects and has been studied by professionals and stargazers</p>

            <h2>Blood Moon</h2>
            <p>This phenomemon only happens during a total lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is positioned between the Sun and the Moon. The Earth's atmosphere breaks up sunlight which causes only red and orange light to reach the Moon. This then gives the moon is "blood" apperance. Many people obseve this event and this event is significant in many cultures.</p>

            <h2>Blue Moon</h2>
            <p>A Blue Moon happens when there is two full moons in one calendar month. Although called a blue Moon, the Moon doesnt actually appear blue. A Blue Moon is not super common and happens around every 2 to 3 years.</p>

            <h2>Harvest Moon</h2>
            <p>A Harvest Moon is known as the full moon that occurs closest to the fall equinox. This event can occur in September or October. The Moon during this time is brighter and rises earlier. This event helped farmers work late during harvest giving it the name "Harvest Moon". Contrary to other full moons the Harvest Moon rises close to sunset over the course of multiple nights providing a longer illumination and golden glow to the atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>Solar Eclipse</h2>
            <p>A solar eclipse is a rare cosmic event when the Moon passes between the Earth and Sun which temporaily blocks the Sun's light. There are partial elipses where only some of the Sun's light is disrupted, and total solar eclipse where all the light is blocked. These eclipses are only visbile from specific areas. These events draw intrest from researched and the general public.</p>
